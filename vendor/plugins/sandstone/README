Sandstone
=========

Introduction goes here.


Dependencies
============
You must be running acts_as_versioned and acts_as_tree to use Sandstone.

The generated tests also require the tester_xtreme plugin, which you can install from http://svn.extendviget.com/lab/trunk/plugins/tester_xtreme.

You do not need to use the RESTful Authentication plugin to use Sandstone, but it will help. At a mininum, you must define the methods +logged_in?+, +current_user+, and +access_denied+ in +ApplicationController+. 

+current_user+ must return an object that can match up with Sandstone's +editor+ object. +access_denied+ should handle redirection and messaging when a non-editor tried to visit an administrative page.


Models
======
Sandstone hooks into your application through a user model. If your users are actually represented by a model named User, you're in luck - all you have to do is add the following line to user.rb:

  has_one :editor
  
It's a little trickier if you've named the model something else (like Member). In that case, add this to your existing model:

  has_one :editor, :foreign_key => :user_id
  
And update editor.rb with the name of your model:

  belongs_to :user, :class_name => "PUT YOUR CLASS NAME HERE"

Whatever user model you use, it should respond to a request for +name+ - that's what the Sandstone admin interface displays for its editors. Note that this means you'll have to add a name method or column to your User model if you're running RESTful Authentication.

Controllers
===========
Add the following line to your ApplicationController:

  include SandstoneSystem
  
If you want to audit editor logins, you should add +Audit.log('login', editor)+ to the action that logs people in.


Routes
======
You must add the following routes (or similar ones) to your config/routes.rb file. Note that +map.sandstone '*path'+ is a catch-all route, so if you're relying on the standard Rails default route (+':controller/:action/:id'+) you may have to do some more work to get Sandstone running.

  map.workspace 'editor/home', :controller => 'editors', :action => 'show'
  map.resources :audits
  map.resources :editors
  map.resources :pages
  map.resources :page_templates
  map.resource  :preview
  map.resource  :sitemap
  map.sandstone '*path', :controller => 'pages', :action => 'show'
